## About Me
Hey, I'm Adam. I'm a student at the University of Toronto Schools, interested in the intersection of CS and other fields such as finance, environmental science, and statistics.

## I'm Currently Working On
I'm currently working on hackathons, capture the flag cybersecurity competitions, and personal projects. I'm exploring financial algorithms, web applications, and deep learning algorithms.

## Languages
The languages I use the most are Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I also have lots of experience using frameworks and libraries such as React.js, Express.js, TensorFlow, Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy, PyTorch, and Flask.
